All contributions and suggestions are very much appreciated, pull requests are encouraged. 

Things you can contribute with:

- Help with improving the overall code coverage (detailed report can be found here: https://codecov.io/gh/nomemory/mockneat) and the quality of the existing unit tests;

- Help with the already [opened issues](https://github.com/nomemory/mockneat/issues);

- Adding new type of MockUnit(s). Eg.: zip code generator, street names generator, etc.;

- Helping with refactoring the code. The code is not perfect and needs certain improvements. Eg.: the markov text generator.

- Investigate the possibility of adding an @Annotations module in order to use MockNeat in a more declarative way. Eg.: Decorate constructors or factory methods.

- Investigate the possibility of moving the dictionary text files into an embedded database instead - additional relationships between the arbitrary can be introduced (eg.: the possibility to generate cities from a given country, or zip codes from a certain region, etc.).
